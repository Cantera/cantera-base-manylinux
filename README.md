'manylinux' Docker images are used to build Python extension modules compatible with many popular Linux distributions. This repository builds HDF5 on top of the standard manylinux images, for using in building h5py.

Images are published [on DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/h5py/manylinux2010_x86_64-hdf5/general).
